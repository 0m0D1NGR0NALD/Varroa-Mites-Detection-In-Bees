# Varroa Mite Detection using YOLOv5.

This repository contains an implementation of Varroa Mite detection using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. Varroa mites are parasitic mites that infest honeybee colonies, causing significant damage to the bees and their hives. The purpose of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient system for automatically detecting Varroa mites in images or video footage.
